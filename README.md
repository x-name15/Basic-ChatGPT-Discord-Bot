# Basic-ChatGPT-Discord-Bot
A basic discord bot that uses the ChatGPT API for its responses
### Hi there, I'm back? I guess
A few months ago I did this little experiment with the ChatGPT API, I know it is a very basic bot but at the time I developed this, the bots using ChatGPT were very scarce

The code has some bugs it seems to me, sometimes **if you give a "prompt" that is too long and specific it takes a little while to respond, no more than approximately 1 minute**

Also keep in mind that **it will use the API Key of your OpenAI account, when it runs out of uses or "tokens" the bot will stop responding unless you buy more "tokens" on the OpenAI developers website**

> I hope this code helps you for your future project, enjoy it!

## I will attach photos of how the bot responds on discord
